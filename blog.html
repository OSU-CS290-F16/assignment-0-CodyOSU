<h3> Challanges of this assignment </h3>
<li> The biggest challange I had on this assigment was trying to figure out how to get the webpage to work and get my html file to be uploaded to it correctly. I ended up looking on Piazza to figure it out, someone said use putty and access the public html file through there and it worked perfectly. </li>

<h3> What did I learn </h3>
<li> I learned a lot from this assignment because I didn't know much prior to it. I never used git or github before but I quickly caught on, so basically everything in this assignment was new to me, html coding, github, piazza and I learned how to use the basics. Super excited to see what else I learn. </li>

<h3> What resources were most helpful </h3>
<li> Piazza was my savior. Any question I had was answered on there. I would just click on someones post and see if someone answered the question and tried out what they suggested, sometimes it didnt work but usually there were many suggestions and one of them seemed to always work for me. </li>
